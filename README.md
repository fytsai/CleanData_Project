CleanData_Project
=================

2 files are provided in this repo for the course project.

1. "run_analysis.R":    
   This is the code used to generate the resulting data file (getDataProject.txt) for the project. The code downloads and unzips the original data into folder "data" of the current working directory. The unzipped files are automatically placed into a subfolder "UCI HAR Dataset". Then the code accessed the datasets from here and its subfolders.
   
2. "CodeBook.md":    
   This markdown file describes the original file, the transformation done by "run_analysis.R", and the variables in the resulting data file (getDataProject.txt) submitted for the project.
